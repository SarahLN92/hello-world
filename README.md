# hello-world
Place to store ideas etc 


I'm starting this blog mostly just to see what blogging is all about- don't want to make a career out of it or have my  blog rake in any extra funds. Mostly just want to write, keep track of goals, practice my web programmer skills, and keep a personal reference!

So, I guess this is the part where I introduce myself and talk about my interests and accomplishments. I'm 24 years old, I live with my girlfriend, Mary, currently in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. I work part-time for the car rental company-Hertz, while also taking part-time classes in Web Development through a local community college. I love books, coffee, and pandas.
